# Masters Project
## Summary
Fourth year Masters project using Neural Networks to model defensive football tactics.

## Technical Highlights
* Building Time series (RNN and LSTM) Neural Networks using pytorch
* Building Convolutional Neural Networks in pytorch
* Dataset modification techniques
* Large data filtering techniques such as Principal Component Analysis
* Supervised machine learning
* Interpreting results from machine learning models

## Files
* Masters Project Redacted 1.pdf contains my first semester Masters project report. Note that the experiment was half completed at this point so the results weren't conclusive.
* Masters Project Redacted 2.pdf contains my second semester Masters project report. Note that further work was completed after the report was written that improved results. These are included in the presentation.
* Masters Project Presentation.pptx contains the powerpoint used to present the project. This contains the work done with CNNs that isn't included in the reports. (Slide 19-end).
* Masters Project Notes Redacted 1.pdf contains my handwritten notes on the project from the first semester. This contains methods that were attempted but not included in the final reports.
* Masters Project Notes Redacted 2.pdf contains my typed notes on the project from the second semester. This contains methods that were attempted but not included in the final reports.
